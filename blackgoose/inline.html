<h2>low and slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called<em>sous vide,</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking,you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.In his book, <em>cooking for geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving<strong> <em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandise.</strong> To reserve a sent at the chef table, contact us before november 30.</p>

<p>Warning: <em>Sous vide</em> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
